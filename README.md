# Sairam's AppleScript Utilities

## Notes
1. **ModifyOptionCmdKeys** is a utility/base script with all of the shared/common code for **RestoreOptionCmdKeys** and **SwapOptionCmdKeys**.
2. Use *Script Editor* to open/edit files.
3. To create executables from **RestoreOptionCmdKeys.applescript** and **SwapOptionCmdKeys.applescript** (a.k.a, "*.app" folders), open each in *Script Editor*, and save as Application.
